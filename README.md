# 🎓 Support System for Predicting Student Academic Performance

This project builds a machine learning-based predictive model to classify students by their academic performance levels based on demographic, behavioral, and institutional factors. It aims to support early intervention and academic planning.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To develop a classification model that predicts students’ academic outcomes (pass/fail or performance levels) using key input features and supports proactive decision-making in educational systems.

## 🌾 AgriTech Relevance
In rural and agricultural regions, education is tightly connected to socio-economic resilience. This support system can be adapted for:
- Predicting dropout risks in farming communities
- Improving access to personalized academic resources
- Strengthening agri-based learning programs through data insights

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🗂️ Files Included
- `Support System for Predicting Student Academic Performance.ipynb`: Full notebook with code and analysis
- `Python project file.pdf`: Detailed report with project description, methodology, evaluation, and results

## 🔍 Key Analysis
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaned and encoded student data, handled missing values
- **Feature Engineering:** Selected relevant attributes to predict performance
- **Modeling:** Built and evaluated multiple classifiers using accuracy, precision, and recall
- **Visualization:** Analyzed feature impacts and model behavior using heatmaps and confusion matrices

## 💡 Outcome
The models successfully identified key indicators of student success and demonstrated potential for integration into broader educational planning systems in underserved communities.

## 🤝 Contribution
This project supports education-focused machine learning for inclusive development, especially where infrastructure gaps exist in rural education systems connected to AgriTech innovation goals.
